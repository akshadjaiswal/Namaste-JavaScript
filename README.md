## What you will learn

24 chapters covering JavaScript from first principles to advanced async patterns. Each chapter has an overview, detailed concept breakdowns, annotated code examples, interview questions with answers, and key takeaways.

**Season 1 — Core JavaScript**

- Execution Context & the Call Stack
- Hoisting, `var` / `let` / `const`
- Scope, Lexical Environment & Scope Chain
- Block Scope, Shadowing & the Temporal Dead Zone
- Closures — how they work, where to use them, when they leak
- `setTimeout` + Closure patterns (the classic interview question)
- First-Class Functions, Anonymous & Named Function Expressions
- Callbacks & Event Listeners
- Asynchronous JS, the Event Loop, Microtask Queue & Starvation
- V8 Architecture — Parsing, AST, JIT, Ignition, TurboFan, Orinoco
- Higher-Order Functions & Functional Programming
- `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` — with real examples

**Season 2 — Async JavaScript**

- Callback Hell & Inversion of Control
- Promises — states, `.then()` chaining, solving IoC
- Promise Chaining & Error Handling — `.catch()` placement, `.finally()`
- `async` / `await` — how suspension works, `try/catch`, parallel execution
- The `this` keyword — every context, `call`/`apply`/`bind`, arrow functions
