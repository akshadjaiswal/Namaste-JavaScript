# Episode 1 : Execution Context

#### Everything in JS happens inside the execution context.

Assume the execution context to be a big box where everything takes place. It has 2 components in it:

<li> <strong>Memory : </strong>The place where all the variables and functions are stored as (key: value) pairs. Memory component is also known as the <em>variable environment</em>.
<li> <strong>Code : </strong>The place where code is executed one line at a time. Code component is also known as the<em>Thread of Execution</em>

### JS is a synchronous single-threaded language.

# Episode 2 : Execution & Call Stack

When a JS program is ran, a global execution context is created.
- The execution context is created in two phases.
- Memory creation phase - JS will allocate memory to variables and functions.
- Code execution phase.
